# This project name is "Youtube Clone"

- The whole idea behind this project is to replicate the original "Youtube" website.
- Primary technology used for this project is React, along with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and MUI React library for styling, icons and layout purposes.
- In this project I have learned to use MUI React library and I have improved my React skills and JavaScript logic.
- Feel free to contact me if you have any questions related to this project!
